# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: tried Exercism, Python. did 3 freecodecamp.org projects. 

**Thoughts:** Failed at getting exercism local files to work. Loved the quick recap on html and css. my brain still tries to do it oldschool. this new (now old) way is so much better.
